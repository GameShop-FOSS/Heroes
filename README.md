# Heroes

## An action adventure epic coming to Google Play Early Access in July 2024

### What is Heroes?

Heroes will be released Early Access in July 2024.  The expected full release date is Summer of 2025.
It is expected to spend 1 Year in Early Access before the full release.  Looking forward to making 
AAA Title that has over 40 hours of Gameplay.  The game will be Free And Open Source Software.  It 
is using Cutting Edge techniques to make High Res Quality graphics.  The same kind of Graphics you 
see generally in a Pixar Film will be coming to the Google Play Store.

### GameShop Corp

I am an Independent Developer.  GameShop Corp isnt a Corporation.  Its just the name of my listing.
What I am actually doing is Sole Proprietorship.  Please dont sue me.  The game is Free And Open Source 
Software.  Please download it on Google to pay me.  Feel free to try it out on Github.  Github is mostly
for Archiving.

### What Am I Using?

The engine I am using is called the JMonkeyEngine.  For all you know it is my own personal game engine.

I am using a Cutting Edge technique that improves production 100x over.  It is called a Bezier Manifold.
I can bravely claim that it is more advanced than Blender.  It is a way to 3D Model with Code.  Without having
to use an editor like Maya Or Blender.  For all you know I came up with Blender.  The new style Im using is 
more advanced than that.

I refer to it in the code as CurrencyMesh.  This is how I use the Bezier Manifold.  Greatest props to Pierre Bezier.
Rest in Peace.  September 1st, 1910 to November 25th, 1999.  If it werent for Bezier I dont know what Id do.  This
equation didnt exist before the 1960s.  It is an honor for me to use it for Video Game Programming.

I also have a few other techniques I am using.  Custom textures.  No need for Photoshop.  Every texture will be made
on the spot.  I am making my own custom formats for that.  No need for Photoshop, Gimp, or Blender.

This is the pinnacle of 3D Model Programming.  There isnt anything better that exists in the world.  It can compete 
with Unreal.
